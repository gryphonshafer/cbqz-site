# Suggestions for CBQ Regions

The following are shared ideas for CBQ regions to consider implementing in whole or in part or to use merely as inspiration for other ideas of their own.

## Club Lists

A “club list” is a subset of the material for a season that’s published for the quizzers prior to the season starting. A region can select a “Club 100” size and a second, larger size that approaches half the material. We selected 100 for the smaller set because 100 works out to less than 4 verses a week during the study season, which should be attainable by nearly all quizzers willing to be persistent in their study.

With club lists published, we can at regional meets adjust the probability of verse selection between the lists and full material, tipping the scales in favor of the lists. For brackets where competition is weaker, the club list verses are more common, which encourages quizzers who’ve studied from the lists. But for more advanced quizzers, there are still queries from the full material. This helps give weaker quizzers more opportunities to get queries correct while preserving opportunities for more advanced quizzers to distinguish themselves.

[QuizSage](https://quizsage.org) provides an easy weighting mechanism to support verse selection probabilities with club lists. A material label can contain “aliases,” which are just embedded, previously-saved material labels. And ranges within a material label can be postfixed with a weight. So for example, “Luke 1-6 (1); Luke 7-12 (3) NIV” would result in 25% of queries being sourced from the first 6 chapters and 75% being sourced from the second 6 chapters. Labels can also support intersections. For example, “Luke 1-3 ~ Luke 2-4” would mean Luke 2-3.

Combining these three concepts, we can create a label like: “Luke 1-12 ~ Club 100 (1); Luke 1-12 ~ Club 300 (2); Luke 1-12 (3) NIV”

### Club List Weighting

A region can elect to shape the difficulty of their quizzes by adjusting the weights for each club list and full material per bracket. For example, the following is a club lists weighting template:

- Preliminary score sum quizzes:
    - Club 100: weight of 1
    - Club 300: weight of 2
    - Full Material: weight of 3
- Positional quizzes and finals/championships quizzes:
    - Club 100: weight of 0
    - Club 300: weight of 1
    - Full Material: weight of 1
- Auxiliary score sum quizzes:
    - Club 100: weight of 3
    - Club 300: weight of 2
    - Full Material: weight of 1

## Individual Averages

CBQ regions can calculate quizzer individual averages in a variety of ways. We often compute meet averages as follows:

- Each bracket's quizzes are averaged *(with exceptions; see next)*
- Finals/championships quiz scores do not count toward individual averages
- Auxiliary score sum quizzes have their averages reduced by 50%

We reduce auxiliary bracket score sum quizzes because in these quizzes the competition is lighter and therefore a quizzer of a given preparation level would, all other things being equal, score higher in auxiliary quizzes than they would in positional bracket quizzes.

We can compute quizzer individual averages for a season as follows:

- Pre-season meets are ignored
- For meets 1, 2, and 3: drop the lowest score of these, then the remaining 2 count 10% each
- For meet 4: count at 20%
- For meet 5: count at 25%
- District Championships: count at 35%

## Team Positions

Total a team’s placements across all meets in a season. For example, a team in 5th, 1st, and 3rd across 3 meets has a “golf score” of 9. Then sort ascending the teams based on “golf score”. Ties are decided by the team with the most best placements, last worst placements, then random.

## Awards

In the interest of trying to encourage quizzers to invest ever more in memorization, we’ve tried implementing additional awards and recognition.

### VRA

When a quizzer earns 7 personal points on a query, they do so by selecting all the quizzer-selected subtypes. These are verbatim (“V”), with reference (“R”), and add-a-verse (“A”), thus making the “VRA” acronym. At the end of the meet, every quizzer who correctly responded to a VRA query is recognized with a VRA badge award.

### Rookie of the Meet

Another award option is that of “Rookie of the Meet”. It’s presented to the rookie quizzer who ranked highest at the meet (and who has not previously won the award). A “rookie” is someone for whom the current season is their first season engaged in quizzing.
