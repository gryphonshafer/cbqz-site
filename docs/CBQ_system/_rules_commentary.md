# CBQ Rules Commentary

## Rules Theory and Architecture

- Rules designed to maximize missional outcomes
    - Sometimes that's simple and obvious
    - But most of the time it's complex due to multi-variable inputs/outputs and multi-order effects
- Objective = fair (but occationally ugly as a result; sharp corners)

## Query Types Test Different Depths

I made a very small change to the rule book to alter some text that could have led to misunderstanding on how to rule on Verbatim Finish queries. Under a Finish query, any word of the prompt at least partially uttered by the magistrate is not required in the quizzer’s response.

However, the Verbatim section of the rule book used “text” and “verse” instead of “response” and “required content”. This could have led to some thinking that the quizzer would have to say the QM-spoken words of the prompt when completing a full rotation, when actually the words at least partially uttered by the magistrate are not required.

## Replacing Queries

- QM errors

Avoid Replacing Queries Based on Responses

I noticed this happening in a couple rooms, so I want to draw attention to it: There should never be a situation where a QM replaces a query based on a quizzer’s response. If there’s a loud sound or other distraction during your prompt reading, replace the query immediately. A loud sound or other distraction is not like pass interference in an NFL game; it doesn’t give the quizzer a free pass to be protected from an error. And if you stumble in reading the query, determine if it’s just a hiccup or if you said something wrong (i.e. wrong word or invalid order). If the former, keep the query; if the latter, replace the query immediately. But in no case should you wait to see if the quizzer can respond correctly.

## Distractions

- Distractions, to be actionable, must be eggregious
    - require immediate action or nothing (and are not challengable)

## Possibly Instantly Correct

There can be situations, though extremely rare, when a quizzer can be technically correct immediately upon being first to trigger. Consider the following scenario:

Let’s say Translation A has a verse: “Jesus drank down some extremely yummy coffee when he woke up early the next morning.” And let’s also say Translation B records the same verse as: “When Jesus woke up early the next morning, he drank down some extremely yummy coffee.” And let’s say that we have a Phrase query from Translation A that reads: “Jesus drank down some extremely yummy coffee…” And let’s further say that the first trigger, from a quizzer who memorized Translation B, occurs after the QM starts uttering the word “coffee”. In that case, technically, the quizzer is instantly correct.

Why? Because “the position in the material content of the translation on the quizzer’s registration that corresponds to the position following the last word the QM at least partially uttered in the source translation” (rule book section 2.5) is at the end of the verse.

And it gets even weirder. Technically, the quizzer, having been first to trigger, is not able to call for quizzer-selected subtypes because they can only call for quizzer-selected subtypes at a “time prior to providing a complete response” (rule book section 2.3.2), but in this scenario, they are instantly correct; thus “a complete response” is technically no response.

Now, keep in mind this is an extremely rare scenario. The translations have to line up in just the right way, the query has to be constructed in just the right way, and the first quizzer to trigger has to trigger at a precise point. But yes, technically, it’s possible.
