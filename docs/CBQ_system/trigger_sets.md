# Lesser Magistrates

Lesser Magistrates (or “LMs” for short) are the hand-held triggers and light console systems preferred for use with Christian Bible Quizzing.

[Jonathan Van Schenck](https://github.com/jonathanvanschenck) designed and wrote the documentation for LMs. Prior to Jonathan’s elegant solution, Bible Quizzing had a fairly high barrier to entry, which included high-cost triggering systems, typically in the area of US$700+ for seat pad sets or well over US$1500+ for bench sets. Some of these sets were prone to failures after heavy use and were difficult for the typical coach to repair.

By contrast, Jonathan’s LM design’s parts can be purchased for roughly US$90. They are extremely robust by contrast to legacy systems. And the parts list, build instructions, and 3D-printing STK/CAD files are published and all open source:

Lesser Magistrates are:

- Simple, providing only the required functionality necessary to magistrate a quiz
- Low cost, with easily available parts
- Easily manufacture-able without special tooling
- Modular in design, allowing for rapid, easy replacement in-quiz of any part that may go bad
- Able to support up to 15 simultaneous participants

## On the Proper Care and Storage of LMs

LMs are extremely robust, which means breakdowns are rare. And when a fault occurs, the LM’s modular design permits rapid in-quiz replacement of the faulty part. However, there are some best practices for care and storage of LMs that will help extend the operational lifetime of all modules.

Due to the LM’s design, faults are most likely to occur at module connection points, where cords plug into things. The telephone and internet cables may have their plastic latches deteriorate after substantial use. And the USB port on the main console unit can sustain internal damage if abrupt pressure is applied vertically to an attached USB cable head.

Therefore, the following are recommendations for care and storage of LMs:

- Prior to packing away an LM:
    - Detach all cords from the main console unit
    - Leave all other cords attached to each other (including triggers and junction boxes)
- When packing an LM in a carrying bag:
    - With each of the 3 sets of cords and triggers
        - Do not wrap or coil the cords around anything
        - Instead, fold them on to themselves at 1.5-foot intervals
        - Then gently place them into the carrying bag
    - Thereafter, add the console box
    - Then add the USB cable and QM trigger with its attached phone cord
- When unpacking an LM from a carrying bag:
    - Try to pull out the console, USB cable, and QM trigger with cord first
    - Then gently remove the 3 folded cords and unfold them
    - To untangle any cords, gently hold them aloft and move them laterally whilst lifting and separating each trigger cord one by one as necessary
- When using the LM, avoid situations where the USB cord when connected to the console might be yanked suddenly
