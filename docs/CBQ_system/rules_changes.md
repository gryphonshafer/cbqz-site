# CBQ Rules Changes

## Rules Theory and Architecture

- Rules designed to maximize missional outcomes
    - Sometimes that's simple and obvious
    - But most of the time it's complex due to multi-variable inputs/outputs and multi-order effects
- Objective = fair (but sometimes can have sharp corners)

## Recent CBQ Rules Changes

Below is a table of recent Christian Bible Quizzing (CBQ) rules changes, including links to read the commentary covering each change and links to the exact rule content changes. The goal is to help explain and provide clear justification for each change. The changes are discussed in reverse chronological order.

## How to Submit a Rules Change Suggestion

1. Submit form
    - Transcribe the current rule + concisely write the desired rule change
    - Explain the ROI (value gained + costs + opportunity costs) as to mission
    - Prove it’s not a [hard cases make bad law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_cases_make_bad_law) situation
        - This principle suggests that creating laws or legal precedents based on extreme, unusual, or highly specific cases—especially those involving personal or emotionally charged circumstances—can lead to poorly crafted laws that are overly broad, narrow, or otherwise unsuitable for general application. It emphasizes the importance of crafting laws based on general principles rather than individual, exceptional events.
        - Detail the inciting incidents (must be ≥2 + where at least 50% are not based on your own teams/quizzers)
    - Steelman the null case + 1 alternative
2. Chancellor forms a (secret) committee to evaluate
3. Chancellor makes final judgement
    - If a change is to be made, writes the changes + writes the explanatory essay
