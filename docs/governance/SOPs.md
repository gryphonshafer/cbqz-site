## Quizzer Eligibility

Coaches are the best able due to their proximity to and time with Quizzing participants to determine the appropriateness of eligibility of each participant for their Quizzing teams. Therefore, head coaches are the ultimate decision-makers as to any given quizzer's eligibility for participation. Any youth who will be 18 or younger at any point during the quiz season and has adequately to their local group's head coach demonstrated maturity sufficient to be a quizzer may participate.
