## Chancellor’s Report

### Summary

#### Completed Work

- Established proto-regions: INW, OR, WWA
- Established an Oregon regional coordinator leadership team
- Established a Western Washington regional coordinator succession plan
- Finance committee met in person with the Chancellor February 21-22 and reviewed CBQ financials
- Built relationships with other Quizzing systems/programs in US/Canada
    - Gryphon is now a member of the World Bible Quizzing Association’s board of directors, which meets every 2 months
- Essays and videos
    - Made some QuizSage tutorial videos
    - Wrote several essays for the CBQ web site including on coaching, leadership requirements, etc.
- Mentored several new and pseudo new coaches
- Built out a CBQ regional CMS and meet registration system allowing regions to self-host/manage their schedules, content, contact lists, etc.
- Added QuizSage functionality
    - Trigger eligibility display
    - Several small bug fixes and security updates
    - Verse corpus popularity data for club list base auto-generation

#### Unfinished Tasks

- Didn’t quite grow Oregon CBQ team organizations by ≥ 20%
    - Added Twin Rivers Church in Springfield
    - Lost River West Church in Lake Oswego
    - Engaged in several weeks of evangelism, but was unable to convert
- Finance committee didn’t established a 2025-2026 budget (yet)
    - We discussed that there’s essentially no good way to do this because CBQ at this point has no expected annual expenses
    - CBQ provides liquidity for LM builds and pays for rookie team organizations’ first LM sets using a grant for that purpose
    - So instead, the finance committee will provide an annual financial report, delivered at each first general assembly meeting per calendar year

#### Tasks To Do

- *Maybe by end of this season (i.e. May 2026),* resign as regional coordinator for Western Washington
- Continue supporting all CBQ activities as Chancellor, serving the regions and their leadership, but as more of a resource for them instead of a director
- QuizSage improvements
    - Material labels version 2 (more complex functionality)
    - Multi-regional season statistics support
    - Material search features additions (toggle search within or across verse boundaries or both)
    - *Maybe by the next GA meeting,* expose most of the interior customization capabilities

### Commentary

CBQ continues to grow in unprecedented ways. For 20+ years, PNW Quizzing steadily shrank. In my first year as Coordinator for PNW Quizzing, which was 6 years ago, PNW Quizzing was at its smallest point; we had 5 team organizations. Just before CBQ started 3 years ago, we were still at 5. The first year of CBQ we grew to 7 team organizations (though 1 attended only 1 meet). Last season, we grew to 11 team organizations (though 2 attended only 1 meet). This season, our third CBQ season, we may have between 13 and 15 team organizations.

This growth is a blessing, but we did encounter some struggles and setbacks. I wore myself out over the season. I served as head coach of one of the new team organizations last year, which was wonderful, but it became a bit too much given having to manage everything else. So to maintain sustainability, I’ve stepped back from the head coach role. I’ve been and am planning to continue to assist several team organizations this season, but I won’t be head coaching or being the primarily leader of any team organization.

Unfortunately, we had to cancel IOC 2025 due to insufficient team registrations. I think the IOC 2025 leadership team did a good job planning, preparing, and evangelizing. This sort of IOC cancelation had been anticipated since before CBQ initiation. In fact, I had expected IOC 2023 to be a single kick-off event only. My original idea was that IOC would be every other year or maybe once every 3 years. I was pleasantly surprised when there was significant enough interest for IOC 2024 to happen.

My summer was extremely busy with evangelism, especially across Oregon. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to build as much traction and adoptions as I had hoped. But the initial seeds of the idea of Bible Quizzing have been planted with over a hundred churches.

My focus from this summer has been and through this season will continue to be setting up CBQ to be sustainable over the long term without my continued involvement. Though I plan to continue serving Bible Quizzing as long as I’m able, I want CBQ and its regions to survive me. We’ve been able to grow PNW Quizzing to a point where it’s right at the edge of viably splitting into 3 semi-autonomous regions. I’ve invested time and work into technology to help us in this regard. But I’m also investing in succession planning, raising up and mentoring the next generation of regional leadership.

The 2025-2026 season will for me mostly be about continuing these activities and bringing these initiatives to conclusion.
