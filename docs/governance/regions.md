# Regional Organizations

Christian Bible Quizzing (CBQ) operates collaboratively across our **regions**. A region is typically though not necessarily geographic, small enough to support in-person meets but large enough to include as many teams as possible.

Regions may include youth or adult leagues or a combination of leagues. Regions may overlap their geographies, and they may merge or split in whatever ways they deem optimum to support the mission.

Christian Bible Quizzing (CBQ) grants regions (once self-instantiated) [license to use the CBQ system](license.md). CBQ obliges regions to remain accountable to their commitments to the terms of the license via annual leadership interviews.

Regions and proto-regions exist in 1 of 3 stages: provisional, subsidiary, or incorporated.

## Provisional

A “provisional region” is a proto-region, a group who are likely to become a region in the near future or are already in the process of becoming a region. Provisional regions are typically treated as part of some existing region for the purposes of governance, license, and treasury; however, they may be listed as separate regions on the CBQ web site or in other publications and technologies.

## Subsidiary

A subsidiary region operates as independent region in terms of quiz meet and team organization leadership operations, but it runs its governance and treasury through CBQ. Subsidiary regions must agree to conform to all applicable provisions of CBQ [articles](articles.md), [bylaws](bylaws.md), [SOPs](SOPs.md), and other policies such as youth protection policies.

## Incorporated

Incorporated regions are self-instantiating organizations, entirely self-governing, and managing their own treasuries. Incorporated regions operate almost like CBQ franchises, though without any cost or fees required by CBQ. To self-instantiate, a region must establish its own articles of incorporation and bylaws for self-governance.

CBQ requires the following of each incorporated region:

- Its articles of incorporation must include the CBQ mission: *to encourage the most people to memorize the most verses of Scripture.*
- It must enfranchise through its articles of incorporation only its adult participants who professes theologically traditional Christianity, meaning they are in alignment with the Nicene Creed (Symbolum Nicaenum), the English translation of the Armenian version.
- Its articles of incorporation must require it operate such that it qualifies as a 501(c)(3) non-profit if within the United States or similar tax-exempt non-profit status if within Canada.
- Its articles of incorporation must agree to adhere to the terms of the regional [CBQ license](license.md).
- Its bylaws must explicitly encode an article of transparency.
- It must establish and enforce operational and governance standard operating procedures.
- It must establish and enforce youth protection practices should they oversee youth.
