# Regional Organizations

Christian Bible Quizzing (CBQ) is operates collaboratively across our **regions**.
A region is typically though not necessarily geographic, small enough to support
in-person meets but large enough to include as many teams as possible.
A region may include youth or adult leagues or a combination of leagues.

Regions may overlap their geographies, and they may merge or split in whatever
ways they deem optimum to support the mission.

Regions are self-instantiating organizations and may be self-governing. Regions
operate almost like CBQ franchises, though without any cost or fees required by
CBQ. To self-instantiate, a region must either establish its own articles of
incorporation and bylaws for self-governance or it may operate as a subsidiary
of CBQ.

If a region elects to self-govern:

- Its articles of incorporation must include the CBQ mission: *to encourage the most people to memorize the most verses of Scripture.*
- It must enfrancise through its articles of incorporation only its adult participants who professes theologically traditional Christianity, meaning they are in alignment with the Nicene Creed (Symbolum Nicaenum), the English translation of the Armenian version.
- Its articles of incorporation must require it operate such that it qualifies as a 501(c)(3) non-profit if within the United States or similar tax-exempt non-profit status if within Canada.
- Its bylaws must explicitly encode an article of transparency.

If a region elects to operate as a subsidiary of CBQ:

- It must agree to conform to all applicable provisions of applicable CBQ [articles](articles.md), [bylaws](bylaws.md), and [SOPs](SOPs.md).

Christian Bible Quizzing (CBQ) grants regions once self-instantiated [license to use the CBQ system](license.md).
