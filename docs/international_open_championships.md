# International Open Championships

**Christian Bible Quizzing** (CBQ) is a radical new form of Quizzing that allow quizzers from a variety of traditions and translations to quiz together in an exciting environment with increased individual and team scoring options. The **International Open Championships** (IOC), hosted on the beautiful campus of [Seattle Pacific University](https://spu.edu)  from July 11-13, will include teams from across the United States and Canada from Free Methodist, Nazarene, World, CMA, other programs both pre-existing and new. We expect to run junior and senior youth competitive divisions as well as an adult division. And when not quizzing, there will be optional fun activities for all including laser tag, a talent show, and various other games.

Don't miss out on this opportunity to fellowship with Quizzing people you might otherwise never meet and to experience what we're working hard to make the most fun quiz meet in recent memory. This meet is an open invitational. All who are interested in participating are invited and encouraged to submit their interest. The goal of the meet is to Bible Quiz across many programs and styles, building bridges and advancing interest in Bible Quizzing.

## Common Questions

> How much will IOC cost per quizzer or per team?

There is no cost to participate in IOC meet itself. (CBQ is covering those expenses.)

SPU will be providing food and housing for our convenience. Meals will be served in a “Through the Line Service” process where we’ll be given a swipe card for entrance into the SPU cafeteria. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are $10.10, $14.25, and $19.50 respectively per person per meal. (Service begins at 7:30 AM, noon, and 5:30 PM daily.) Overnight housing will be in the Ashton Hall dormitory. Each room sleeps 2 and is $55 per person per night.

> What’s the age range or age limits for participating in IOC?

There's no official age range or limit, though IOC leadership feels the meet is best suited for quizzers in middle school and high school. However, it's entirely up to coaches and programs to evaluate the maturity level and readiness of their quizzers.

> Wait, you said “adult division”? Are you serious?

Yes. We’re serious. We fully expect there to be enough registrations to support an “adult division”. This will be a separate division from the “main event” youth Bible Quizzing division.

> What will be the material for the IOC meet?

We expect the material label for IOC will be: "Acts 1-20 BSB NIV". (See the [the CBQ rule book](rules/CBQ_rule_book.md) for an explanation for what a material label is and means.)

> What's the meet schedule going to be like?

Most folks from out-of-state will be arriving at SPU Monday afternoon and evening. Dinner service begins at 5:30 PM Pacific. CBQ will have staff at Ashton Hall from 3 PM to 5:30 PM to check in arrivals; however, if you’ll be arriving outside that window, please let us know, and we’ll ensure someone is there to meet you.

Tuesday morning, breakfast service begins at 7:30 AM. Since the CBQ system is new for most teams, we’ll being the day Tuesday with a period of practice quizzes starting at 9:30 AM. After everyone has had a chance to experience at least 1 practice quiz, we’ll break to allow teams to regroup before proceeding with our initial rounds of score sum quizzes.

By Thursday, we’ll conclude our positional brackets and move into finals and awards. Each evening, including Thursday evening, there will be something fun planned for all.
