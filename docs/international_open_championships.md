# International Open Championships (IOC)

The **International Open Championships (IOC)** is Christian Bible Quizzing’s annual season-end tournament, open to all teams who’d like to participate.

## IOC 2024

This season’s IOC will be hosted at:

- Location: [Cascade Christian Schools High School](https://www.cascadechristian.org)
- Address: [811 21st St SE, Puyallup, WA 98372](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//811+21st+St+SE,+Puyallup,+WA+98372)
- Dates: Friday and Saturday, July 26 and 27, 2024

IOC includes teams from across the United States and Canada from a variety of Quizzing traditions like Nazarene, World, CMA, other programs both pre-existing and new. We expect to run seperate youth and adult competitive divisions. And when not quizzing, there will be optional fun activities for all including a talent show and various other games.

Don’t miss out on this opportunity to fellowship with Quizzing people you might otherwise never meet and to experience what we’re working hard to make the most fun quiz meet in recent memory. This meet is an open invitational. All who are interested in participating are invited and encouraged to submit their interest. The goal of the meet is to Bible Quiz across many programs and styles, building bridges and advancing interest in Bible Quizzing.

## Common Questions

> What’s the age range or age limits for participating in IOC?

There’s no official age range or limit, though IOC leadership feels the meet is best suited for quizzers in middle school and high school. However, it’s entirely up to coaches and programs to evaluate the maturity level and readiness of their quizzers.

> Wait, you said “adult division”? Are you serious?

Yes. We’re serious. We fully expect there to be enough registrations to support an “adult division”. This will be a separate division from the “main event” youth Bible Quizzing division.

> What will be the material for the IOC meet?

We expect the material label for IOC will be: "Galatians; Ephesians; Philippians; Colossians NASB NIV BSB". (See the [the CBQ rule book](rules/CBQ_rule_book.md) for an explaiation for what a material label is and means.)

> How much will IOC cost per quizzer?

We honestly don’t know. We know it will cost less than the cost to host the meet at SPU, since we have a sizable grant to help bring down costs per quizzer/team. However, we’re not yet sure how far down we can bring the costs, and this is why we’re deploying this multi-phased approach. Much of the costs of putting on IOC are based on the number of quizzers who participate and their travel subsidy needs.

> OK, should I do right now then?

First, evangelize IOC to other quizzers and coaches. Form some IOC-bound teams. Then:
